Upgrading to Newer Releases
===========================

hexonet.apiconnector itself is changing like any software is changing over
time. Most of the changes are the nice kind, the kind where you don't have
to change anything in your code to profit from a new release. These are in
general changes that are released as patch or minor release.

However every once in a while there are changes that do require some
changes in your code or there are changes that make it possible for you to
improve your own code quality by taking advantage of new features in
hexonet.apiconnector. Such breaking changes are covered through major releases.

Use the :command:`pip` command to upgrade your existing hexonet.apiconnector
installation by providing the ``--upgrade`` parameter::

    $ pip3 install --upgrade hexonet.apiconnector
