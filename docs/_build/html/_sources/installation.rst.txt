Installation
============

Python Version
--------------

We recommend using the latest version of Python 3. hexonet.apiconnector
supports Python 3.x and 2.7.

NOTE: Since v3.x (2019-04-01, yes no joke!), we removed python 2.7
 compatibility.


Dependencies
------------

There are NO dependencies to install. If this changes, we will list them
here and they will be installed automatically when hexonet.apiconnector
is getting installed.

There are :ref:`dependencies<requirements>` that we just need in steps of
our build process.

Installation
-------------

Within your environment, use the following command to install
hexonet.apiconnector:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip3 install hexonet.apiconnector

The connector library is now installed. Check out the
:doc:`/quickstart` or go to the
:doc:`Documentation Overview </index>`.
