Requirements
------------

You can find any required library for this project listed in the *pyproject.toml*:

.. literalinclude:: ../pyproject.toml

You can install all you need by

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user --upgrade -e .

Consider doing that using a virtual environment. Read the `docs`.

.. _docs: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/.

NOTE: Make sure to have also all the extensions listed in the `docs/conf.py`
that are required for the SDK Documentation.

.. _docs/conf.py: https://rawgit.com/centralnicgroup-opensource/rtldev-middleware-python-sdk/master/docs/conf.py

We suggest to use `Visual Studio Code`_ with installed plugins for Python
Development described here_. But if you prefer any other IDE / Editor, it
is fine.

.. _testsnvalidation:

Run Tests and Code Validation
-----------------------------

If you open a Pull Request (PR), we will trigger automated tests and pep8 style
check in CI process. So nothing you have to worry about in your development.
You can open your PR and prefix its title with WIP "Work In Progress" to access
these checks in advance.

If there's anything breaking, be so kind to fix it. If you're not able to do it
- feel free to ask for help.

Try to auto-fix pep8 styling issues by

.. code-block:: bash

    # to autofix possible issues
    ./scripts/pep8fix.sh

    # to check for issues left
    ./scripts/pep8check.sh

    # run unit tests
    ./scripts/coverage.sh

Pull Request (PR) Procedure
---------------------------
* fork our project and create a new branch
* clone it and check this branch out
* apply your desired changes / extensions
* commit and push it to remote. Please follow these [commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).  We suggest to use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/blob/master/README.md).
* open a pull request (PR).
* check if the CI process fails. If so, review your code (feel free to ask for help).
* squash your commits as far as it makes sense
* rebase your branch

**We care then about the rest** - no need to worry about things like
building current realease and versioning.

**You can stop here.**

TIA for your PR and thus for your support of this project. As we have
further SDKs in other languages, it might take a bit of time to check
if we can role out that PR as we want to keep all our SDKs aligned.

.. _rules: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
.. _commitizen:  https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/blob/master/README.md

Changes to the documentation will be auto-deployed by a webhook to
readthedocs.org_.

.. _readthedocs.org: https://hexonet-python-sdk.readthedocs.io
.. _github pages: https://hexonet.github.io/python-sdk

The module can be accessed on the `PyPi (Live) Index`_ and the
`PyPi (Test) Index`_.

.. _PyPi (Test) Index: https://test.pypi.org/project/hexonet.apiconnector/

SDK Documentation
-----------------

Have an eye on the generated :ref:`api`.

If you want to generate it from scratch out of the sources, please use
the below script:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/generatedocs.sh

The generated files are then available in subfolder "docs/_build/html".
We regenerate the SDK Documentation whenever a new tag commit reaches
the master branch.
